# BLE Mesh Dimmer demo application

## Overview
This demo application shows a simple dimmer implementation using WICED boards. The app implements the BLE Mesh Generic Level Client model. Normally a dimmer has at least 2 buttons to turn the light on and off. This application performs dimming using a single user button available on the kits.  On a short push, the level is toggled between 0% and 100%. When a button is pushed and not released, the level is changed every 0.5 seconds from 0 to 100 or vice versa in 8 steps of 12.5% each based on the previous LED state. The button can be released before the level reaches 100% and in this case consecutive push or long push will continue increasing the level. If level reaches 100% the next button control will decrease the level.

## Features demonstrated
- Button usage on the WICED Kit
- Controlling of a BLE Mesh light bulb using BLE Mesh Set Level messages

## Instructions
To demonstrate the app, work through the following steps:

1. Build and download the application to the WICED board.
2. Build and download Mesh\_LightDimmable application to another WICED board.
3. Use the MeshClient or ClientControlMesh helper applications to provision the LightDimmable node as a light bulb and the Dimmer node as dimmer.<br/>
Note: ClientControlMesh requires an additional board that must be programmed with the mesh provision client app. Please refer to the 'WICED-MeshClient-And-ClientControlMesh-User-Guide' to learn about these helper applications. The user guide is available in ModusToolbox documentation. Also, this user guide is available under the documentation tab at www.cypress.com/ble-mesh.
4. Configure the dimmer to control the light bulb.<br/>
Note that if the light bulb and the dimmer were provisioned in the same group, the dimmer will be automatically configured to send messages to the group and this step can be skipped.
5. Push/release the user button (SW3) on the dimmer board.  The LED (LED1 on the Mesh Evaluation Kit or LED 2 on the CYW920819EVB-02 Evaluation Kit) on the light bulb   side should turn on.
6. Push/release the user button (SW3) on the dimmer board.  The LED on the light bulb side should turn off.
7. Push and hold the user button (SW3) on the dimmer board.  The LED on the light bulb side should gradually go from Off to On within 4 seconds.
8. Push and hold the application button on the dimmer board.  The LED on the light bulb side should gradually go from On to Off within 4 seconds.
9. Try pushing and holding the button for less than 4 seconds, and all other combinations.
10. For 20721B2 based WICED kits, use the Custom button on audio shield board as application button rather than the button on the base board.

## Details
By default the application does not support Relay, Proxy or Friend features. It can also be compiled to support a Low Power Node by adding #define LOW\_POWER\_NODE  1

## Notes
1. The board will factory reset if you press and hold the user button (SW3) on the board for more than 15 seconds.
2. All mesh apps use a common shared source library for common application framework functionality located at: mtb\_shared\wiced\_btsdk\dev-kit\libraries\btsdk-mesh\COMPONENT\_mesh\_app\_lib\. This library may be edited as needed.  For example, to change the PUART baud rate see mesh\_app\_hci\_init() function in mesh\_app\_hci.c
3. The application GATT database is located in mesh\_app\_lib as well, in file mesh\_app\_gatt.c. If you create a GATT database using Bluetooth Configurator, update the GATT database in the location mentioned above.

## Appication Settings
Application specific project settings are as below:

- MESH\_MODELS\_DEBUG\_TRACES
    - Turn on debug trace from Mesh Models library
- MESH\_CORE\_DEBUG\_TRACES
    - Turn on debug trace from Mesh Core library
- MESH\_PROVISIONER\_DEBUG\_TRACES
    - Turn on debug trace from Mesh Provisioner library
- REMOTE\_PROVISION\_SRV
    - Enable device as Remote Provisioning Server
- LOW\_POWER\_NODE
    - Enable device as Low Power Node

## Common application settings

Application settings below are common for all BTSDK applications and can be configured via the makefile of the application or passed in via the command line.

- BT\_DEVICE\_ADDRESS<br/>
    - Set the BDA (Bluetooth Device Address) for your device. The address is 6 bytes, for example, 20819A10FFEE. By default, the SDK will set a BDA for your device by combining the 7 hex digit device ID with the last 5 hex digits of the host PC MAC address.

- UART<br/>
    - Set to the UART port you want to use to download the application. For example 'COM6' on Windows or '/dev/ttyWICED\_HCI\_UART0' on Linux or '/dev/tty.usbserial-000154' on macOS. By default, the SDK will auto-detect the port.

- ENABLE_DEBUG<br/>
    - For HW debugging, select the option '1'. See the document [WICED-Hardware-Debugging](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/btsdk-docs/blob/master/docs/BT-SDK/WICED-Hardware-Debugging.pdf) for more information. This setting configures GPIO for SWD.

## Folder structure

All BTSDK code examples need the 'mtb\_shared\wiced\_btsdk' folder to build and test the apps. 'wiced\_btsdk' includes the 'dev-kit' and 'tools' folders. The contents of the 'wiced\_btsdk' folder will be automatically populated incrementally as needed by the application being used.

**dev-kit**

This folder contains the files that are needed to build the embedded Bluetooth apps.

* baselib: Files for chips supported by BTSDK. For example CYW20819, CYW20719, CYW20706, etc.

* bsp: Files for BSPs (platforms) supported by BTSDK. For example CYW920819EVB-02, CYW920721B2EVK-02, CYW920706WCDEVAL etc.

* btsdk-include: Common header files needed by all apps and libraries.

* btsdk-tools: Build tools needed by BTSDK.

* libraries: Profile libraries used by BTSDK apps such as audio, LE, HID, etc.

**tools**

This folder contains tools and utilities need to test the embedded Bluetooth apps.

* btsdk-host-apps-bt-ble: Host apps (Client Control) for LE and BR/EDR embedded apps, demonstrates the use of WICED HCI protocol to control embedded apps.

* btsdk-host-peer-apps-mesh: Host apps (Client Control) and Peer apps for embedded Mesh apps, demonstrates the use of WICED HCI protocol to control embedded apps, and configuration and provisioning from peer devices.

* btsdk-peer-apps-ble: Peer apps for embedded LE apps.

* btsdk-peer-apps-ota: Peer apps for embedded apps that support Over The Air Firmware Upgrade.

* btsdk-utils: Utilities used in BTSDK such as BTSpy, wmbt, and ecdsa256.

See README.md in the sub-folders for more information.

## ModusToolbox Tools

Source code generation tools installed by ModusToolbox installer:

- Device Configurator:
      A GUI tool to create custom pin mappings for your device.
- Bluetooth Configurator:
      A GUI tool to create and configure the LE GATT Database and BR/EDR SDP records for your application.

## Using BSPs (platforms)

BTSDK BSPs are located in the \mtb\_shared\wiced\_btsdk\dev-kit\bsp\ folder by default.

#### a. Selecting an alternative BSP

The application makefile has a default BSP. See "TARGET". The makefile also has a list of other BSPs supported by the application. See "SUPPORTED_TARGETS". To select an alternative BSP, use Library Manager from the Quick Panel to deselect the current BSP and select an alternate BSP. Then right-click the newly selected BSP and choose 'Set Active'.  This will automatically update TARGET in the application makefile.

#### b. Custom BSP

**Complete BSP**

To create and use a complete custom BSP that you want to use in applications, perform the following steps:

1. Select an existing BSP you wish to use as a template from the list of supported BSPs in the mtb\_shared\wiced\_btsdk\dev-kit\bsp\ folder.
2. Make a copy in the same folder and rename it. For example mtb\shared\wiced\_btsdk\dev-kit\bsp\TARGET\_mybsp.<br/>
   **Note:** This can be done in the system File Explorer and then refresh the workspace in Eclipse to see the new project.  Delete the .git sub-folder from the newly copied folder before refreshing in Eclipse.
   If done in the IDE, an error dialog may appear complaining about items in the .git folder being out of sync.  This can be resolved by deleting the .git sub-folder in the newly copied folder.

3. In the new mtb\_shared\wiced\_btsdk\dev-kit\bsp\TARGET\_mybsp folder, rename the existing/original (BSP).mk file to mybsp.mk.
4. In the application makefile, set TARGET=mybsp and add it to SUPPORTED\_TARGETS as well as TARGET\_DEVICE\_MAP.  For example: mybsp/20819A1
5. Update design.modus for your custom BSP if needed using the **Device Configurator** link under **Configurators** in the Quick Panel.
6. Update the application makefile as needed for other custom BSP specific attributes and build the application.

**Custom Pin Configuration Only - Multiple Apps**

To create a custom pin configuration to be used by multiple applications using an existing BSP that supports Device Configurator, perform the following steps:

1. Create a folder COMPONENT\_(CUSTOM)\_design\_modus in the existing BSP folder. For example mtb\_shared\wiced\_btsdk\dev-kit\bsp\TARGET\_CYW920819EVB-02\COMPONENT\_my\_design\_modus
2. Copy the file design.modus from the reference BSP COMPONENT\_bsp\_design\_modus folder under mtb\_shared\wiced\_btsdk\dev-kit\bsp\ and place the file in the newly created COMPONENT\_(CUSTOM)\_design\_modus folder.
3. In the application makefile, add the following two lines<br/>
   DISABLE\_COMPONENTS+=bsp\_design\_modus<br/>
   COMPONENTS+=(CUSTOM)\_design\_modus<br/>
   (for example COMPONENTS+=my\_design\_modus)
4. Update design.modus for your custom pin configuration if needed using the **Device Configurator** link under **Configurators** in the Quick Panel.
5. Building of the application will generate pin configuration source code under a GeneratedSource folder in the new COMPONENT\_(CUSTOM)\_design\_modus folder.

**Custom Pin Configuration Only - Per App**

To create a custom configuration to be used by a single application from an existing BSP that supports Device Configurator, perform the following steps:

1. Create a folder COMPONENT\_(BSP)\_design\_modus in your application. For example COMPONENT\_CYW920721B2EVK-03\_design\_modus
2. Copy the file design.modus from the reference BSP under mtb\_shared\wiced\_btsdk\dev-kit\bsp\ and place the file in this folder.
3. In the application makefile, add the following two lines<br/>
   DISABLE\_COMPONENTS+=bsp\_design\_modus<br/>
   COMPONENTS+=(BSP)\_design\_modus<br/>
   (for example COMPONENTS+=CYW920721B2EVK-03\_design\_modus)
4. Update design.modus for your custom pin configuration if needed using the **Device Configurator** link under **Configurators** in the Quick Panel.
5. Building of the application will generate pin configuration source code under the GeneratedSource folder in your application.


## Using libraries

The libraries needed by the app can be found in in the mtb\_shared\wiced\_btsdk\dev-kit\libraries folder. To add an additional library to your application, launch the Library Manager from the Quick Panel to add a library. Then update the makefile variable "COMPONENTS" of your application to include the library. For example:<br/>
   COMPONENTS += fw\_upgrade\_lib
